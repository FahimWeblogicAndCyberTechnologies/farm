    The Products page should showcase the different types of poultry products that the farm offers. 
    This may include chicken, turkey, eggs, and other poultry-related products. Each product should have its own page with a detailed description, high-quality images, and pricing information. 
    This page should also feature an online ordering system for customers to purchase products directly from the website.
